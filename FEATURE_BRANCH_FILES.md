# This branch: WBB Transfer Dashboard

This branch contains the **entire dashboard** so contributors can get started with the WBB Transfer Portal UI.

## What’s included

- **`dashboard/`** — Full React/Vite app (filters, player cards, charts). No backend; runs with mock data.

## Run it

```bash
cd dashboard
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173

## Data

The UI uses mock data by default. You can later point it at your own data or APIs.
